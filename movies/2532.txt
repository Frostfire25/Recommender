David Asmmann's Football Under Cover documents the hard work involved in setting up an exhibition soccer match, known as a ""friendly,"" between a German girls squad and Iranian women's team. In addition to showing how the two groups come from very different cultures, the documentary showcases what playing the game means to the members of both teams, and displays how passionate the fans of these two squads are.
