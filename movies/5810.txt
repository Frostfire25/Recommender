Gamers is a comedy about the lives of four slacker friends (and one obsessive interloper) living at home, -""with my parents... it's just temporary... 'til they die""- working in the real world but playing in a fantasy world. Obsessed with a role playing game called Demons, Nymphs and Dragons these ""gamers"" are the subject of this hilarious comedy.
