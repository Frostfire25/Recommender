Sunken Treasure follows Wilco frontman Jeff Tweedy on his February 2006 solo acoustic tour. The footage was recorded over five nights and features songs from three of his current and former bands: Wilco, Uncle Tupelo, and Loose Fur, plus an unreleased track, ""The Thanks I Get."" The film is directed by documentarians Christoph Green and Brendan Canty, himself the former drummer of Fugazi.
