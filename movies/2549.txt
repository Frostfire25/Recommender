Down these mean streets a man must come.  A hero born, murdered, and born again.  A Rookie cop named Denny Colt returns from the beyond as The Spirit, a hero whose mission is to fight against the bad forces from the shadows of Central City.  The Octopus, who kills anyone unfortunate enough to see his face, has other plans; he is going to wipe out the entire city.
