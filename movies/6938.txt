Back in Vietnam, Major Whittmar (Paul Gleason) sold out his comrades to save his own skin.  Now, he's a rich, ruthless land baron who's getting richer by squeezing out or killing off his neighbors.  But when he and his cronies murder a rancher who threatens to expose them, the man's son, Will (Ken Olandt), swears vengeance.
