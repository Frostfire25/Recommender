Hark! The Herald Pundit Sings! America’s favorite Christmas tradition is now on DVD! Families have gathered around the TV to enjoy Stephen Colbert’s Christmas specials every year since 2008. Now, you can experience the joy over and over! Join Stephen and his friends—Toby Keith, Elvis Costello, John Legend, Feist, Willie Nelson, and Jon Stewart —for a yuletide evening of song, dance and nog-induced dementia. (Parental discretion is advised.) Remember, every time you buy a copy of Stephen Colbert’s Christmas Special, an angel gets his wings.
