The tribes of Israel need to defeat the superior might of the Philistines: ""Now appoint a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have."" (I Samuel, 8:5). And so the prophet Samuel gives the Hebrews their first king, Saul.  Saul, however, has incessant doubts about his mission. The influential prophet Samuel turns away from Saul in order to select a new king according to God's will: David. He is still a young boy, tending sheep in the fields, when, secretly Samuel oints him as the next king of the Israelites.
