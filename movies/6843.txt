Joe, a young American soldier, is hit by a mortar shell on the last day of World War I. He lies in a hospital bed with a fate worse than death as a quadruple amputee who has lost his arms, legs, eyes, ears, mouth and nose. Unbeknown to his doctors, he remains conscious and able to think, thereby reliving his life through strange dreams and memories.
