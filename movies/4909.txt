It's 1905 when 12 year old Sophia plays all by herself in her big, creepy house with only four handmade dolls as friends. When her abusive father has finally had enough, he forces her to bury them in the backyard. But, after she ""slips"" and breaks her neck, dad buries her right along with the dolls. 100 years later, the Fillbrook family moves into the very same house.
