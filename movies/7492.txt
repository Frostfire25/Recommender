Murray is a male fairy godmother, and he is trying to help 8-year-old Anabel to fulfil her ""simple wish"" - that her father Oliver, who is a cab driver, would win the leading role in a Broadway musical. Unfortunately, Murray's magic wand is broken and the fairies convention is threatened by evil witches Claudia and Boots.
