Gypo is the story of a working class family in Margate, Kent, a town where immigrants have become the focus of most of the public's discontent.  The film tells the story of the a couple of weeks in this family's life, beginning when a young Czech girl, Tash, comes to visit.  The film is made in the Dogme95 tradition, so no costumes, no lighting, no props or sets, which gives the film a gritty texture appropriate to the story.
