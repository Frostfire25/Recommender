A group of New Yorkers caught up in their romantic/sexual milieu converge at Shortbus, an underground Brooklyn salon infamous for its blend of art, music, politics, and carnality, and loosely inspired by various underground NYC gatherings that took place in the early 2000s. Here, gay couple Jamie (PJ DeBoy) and James (Paul Dawson) meet Ceth (Jay Brannan), a young ex-model and aspiring singer.
