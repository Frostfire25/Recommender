Experience the triumphs, the tears, the traumas and the trousers when Robert Peter Williams blows into London Town for one night only. Rub shoulder pads with a star-studded audience as Mr Success and his 58 piece orchestra serenade you with the songs that make the young girls crazy. Recorded on 10th October 2001 in the Royal Albert Hall.
