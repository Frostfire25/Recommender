This video is not your typical collection of music videos. Rather than being simply a straightforward presentation of videos, SINGLE VIDEO THEORY also contains footage of the band members recording their album in the studio. The camera captures the actual recording sessions as well as the band members chatting candidly about their concept and ideas for the music. Directed by Mark Pellington and shot in 16mm over 3 days in 1997.
