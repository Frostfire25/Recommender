My Lovely","LA private eye Philip Marlowe (Robert Mitchum) is hired by ex-con Moose Malloy to find his girlfriend. While also investigating the murder of a client and the theft of a jade necklace, Marlowe becomes entangled with seductress Helen Grayle (Charlotte Rampling) and discovers a web of dark secrets that are better left hidden. Soaked in 1940s period detail, Farewell, My Lovely is a neo noir remake of the 1944 film but it follows the original Raymond Chandler's novel more closely.
