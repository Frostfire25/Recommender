A man with a ""doormat"" personality tries standing up for himself for a change in this comedy. Mild mannered tax accountant Elliot Sherman is what he calls a ""Baxter"": the kind of calm, unexciting fellow who ""wears sock garters"" and ""enjoys raking leaves."" Loved by bosses and parents, Elliot is a perfectly nice guy. And that's his problem.
