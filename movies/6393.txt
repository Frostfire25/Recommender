Frank Skinner has been in the stand-up game for well over 20 years and this DVD showcases him at the peak of his talents at the Birmingham's National Indoor Arena (NIA) in front of a packed audience as part of his 2007 tour. Since quitting TV 2 years ago, Skinner has focused on his stand-up and this show is the culmination of those efforts.
