You can’t have all the things we love like skiing and snow without a good Storm. Follow along as skiers and riders like Seth Morrison, Toby Dawson, Jeremy Bloom, Tanner Hall, and Glen Plake tackle every condition and obstacle in their way head on in order to ski some of the freshest snow around. Warren Miller takes you on a trip from Idaho, California, and Colorado, all the way to Canada, Austria and even to the distant country of Georgia and along the way proves that a good Storm can happen wherever you’re at.
