A young man is confined in a mental hospital. Through a flashback we see that he was traumatized as a child, when he and his family were circus performers: he saw his father cut off the arms of his mother, a religious fanatic and leader of the heretical church of Santa Sangre (""Holy Blood""), and then commit suicide. Back in the present, he escapes and rejoins his surviving and armless mother.
