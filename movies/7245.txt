In the UK suburbs, an underground tournament is set to challenge twelve fighters from different backgrounds to compete for the price of Â£500,000. They have been handpicked for a no-holds barred competition that will push each fighter to their limit. Each fighter has their own reason for competing, and each will give everything they've got to take the prize...but there can be only one winner.
