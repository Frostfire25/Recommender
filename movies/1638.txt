Blondie (Penny Singleton) finds a valuable watch that has been hidden by hubby Dagwood (Arthur Lake).  She assumes that it's a surprise wedding gift, but the truth is that Dagwood has been guarding the watch on behalf of a client who bought the gift for his own wife.  The snowballing comedy of errors eventually involves criminals who hope to snatch the watch for themselves.  Blondie's Anniversary was the 22nd in Columbia's Blondie series.
