Tongue-in-cheek chiller about a ruthlessly sadistic student who will stop at nothing in pursuit of advancing his shocking scientific experiments. Young Victor Frankenstein murders his own father in order to inherit his title and fortune, and drops out of school to concentrate on his unholy attempts to resurrect dead creatures.
