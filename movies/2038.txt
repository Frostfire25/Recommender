Mr. Teas is a door to door salesman for dentists' appliances. Everywhere he goes he encounters beautiful ""well-developed"" nude women, which of course stir his interest. The only sound in the film is the voice of a narrator and a very monotonic musical theme played on the clarinet or some similar instrument.
