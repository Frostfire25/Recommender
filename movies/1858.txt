From Toni Basil to the Eurythmics, from friendship bracelets to whip-it's, the summer of 1984 was about as 80s as the 80s ever got. Stuck right in the middle of it is Eric Hunter, heading towards his senior year, and passing the summer working at a local amusement park in the fast food restaurant. He is joined by his long time girl/friend Maggie, as they don their ugly brown polyester uniforms and face the world.
