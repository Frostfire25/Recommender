In 1978 Jeff Wayne composed and produced one of the most groundbreaking and best-selling musical works of all time. In 2006, after much anticipation, Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of The Worlds was brought to the stage for the first time, playing to sold-out arenas.  This version filmed at Wembley Arena (UK) on 25th April 2006.
