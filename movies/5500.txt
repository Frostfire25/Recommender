Natural changes have the clans moving. Iza, medicine woman of the ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" finds little Ayla from the ""others""' clan - tradition would have the clan kill Ayla immediately, but Iza insists on keeping her. When the little one finds a most needed new cave, she's allowed to stay - and thrive.
