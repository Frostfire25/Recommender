A brilliant but deranged neurosurgeon becomes obsessively fixated on a judge's daughter who in no way wants him. With the help of an escaped criminal whose face he has surgically deformed, the mad man lures her, her father and her fianc√© to his isolated castle-like home, where he has created a torture chamber with the intent of torturing them for having 'tortured' him.
