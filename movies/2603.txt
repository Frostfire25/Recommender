Jake, full of anger after his father's death, is just starting to find a place for himself at his new Orlando high school - until Ryan, head of an underground MMA fight club, picks Jake out as a prime opponent.

But it becomes obvious that a rematch will be inevitable if Jake wants to stop Ryan and his bullying, once and for all.
