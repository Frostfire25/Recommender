For For Right Or Wrong is a documentary feature made in conjunction with Burton Snowboards, which profiles several of the companies sponsored riders in their various snow board disciplines; Pipe, Street, Free Ride and Big Air. A large part of the action takes place around the snowboard wunderkind Shaun White, as he prepares to compete in the 2006 winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy. The other various narrative strands follow the different paths of the individual boarders as we see them in action and they talk about why it is they do what they do. The film also introduces Burton Snow Board founder and CEO of Burton, Jake Burton Carpenter.
