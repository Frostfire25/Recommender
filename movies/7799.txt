Continuing the popular series from Fleshwound Films, this highlight video shows some of the more insane things people have tried to do with motorcycles. Filled with death defying leaps from motocross events and off track leaps and hill climbs, this film moves at a frenetic pace. Several professional motocross riders, including Seth Enslow, pull off some amazing stunts and jumps. This is the fourth entry in the Crusty Demons of Dirt series.
