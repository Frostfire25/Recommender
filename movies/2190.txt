When Miss Marple arrives at palatial Stonygates, one thing is certain. Before there's time to lather a warm scone with marmalade and place a tea cozy, murder most foul is bound to occur. Helen Hayes returns as spinster sleuth Jane Marple and Leo McKern plays the crafty inspector who teams with her in this engaging, twisty case of country-house intrigue. Someone may be slowly poisoning the aging lady of the manor (the great Bette Davis in one of her last roles). Everyone but her dutiful husband (John Mills) has a motive. The snappish housekeeper? The pompous school kid? The gun-collecting American? The uneasy psychiatrist? The embittered daughter? It could be one of them. Some of them. None of them. People are dying - but not the elderly grand dame of Stonygates!
