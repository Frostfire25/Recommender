Psycho Joe babysits his brain-damaged father without a friend in the world, living in squalor in the suburbs of Melbourne. Joe loves one thing: Fast cars! When he gets a job at a local supermarket, Joe meets fellow ""petrol head"" Dazey, who quickly becomes his idol and best friend. Soon after, Joe falls for Savina, a goth girl who practices black magic. But Savina has already fallen for Dazey and will do anything to get him -- including using Joe's feelings for her. In true Shakespearean fashion, this trio race down the road to tragedy.
