Bruce Brown's The Endless Summer is one of the first and most influential surf movies of all time. The film documents American surfers Mike Hynson and Robert August as they travel the world during Californiaâ€™s winter (which, back in 1965 was off-season for surfing) in search of the perfect wave and ultimately, an endless summer.
