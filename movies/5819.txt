""Wiggle Bay"" is more of the cute musical fun that the Wiggles always deliver, but with a story line, an actual plot this time. The Wiggles, off on a little jaunt to sunny Wiggle Bay for the day are having a blast, until silly Captain Feathersword announces that he's forgotten to tie off their boat- and they're stranded! Whoops!
