Mr X, the worlds most famous traffic violator is back in town! This time in a car well known from the movie The Fast and the Furious, a supertuned Mazda Rx-7 pushed to the limit. Together with a friend in a just as fast supercar they show that after sunset in Stockholm another life begins where they own the streets, sometimes at speeds up to 300 km/h.
