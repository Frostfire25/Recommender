Multi-platinum recording artists release their first-ever live DVD. Recorded in April 2005, the shows were filmed in the band's hometown of Atlanta during two special sold-out performances featuring the Atlanta Symphony Youth Orchestra. The 20-song collection spans ninety minutes and encompasses hits from Collective Soul's seven studio albums, including their latest release, ""Youth"".
