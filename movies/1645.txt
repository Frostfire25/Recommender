The ""Blondie"" series reaches Number 26 with Blondie Hits the Jackpot.  Fired for messing up an important contract, Dagwood (Arthur Lake) takes a job as a manual laborer for a construction firm.  Of interest is the fact that Dagwood and Blondie's son Alexander (Larry Simms), is now shaving and going out with girls--a far cry from his ""Baby Dumpling"" days in the series' earliest entries.
